  <h1>About <%= link_to "All Day Visualizer", {:action => "visualizer"} %></h1>

  <p>
    <%= link_to "All Day", "http://illegal-art.net/allday/" %>
    is the 5th album by the spectacular <%= link_to "Girl Talk",
    "http://www.facebook.com/girltalkmusic" %>, composed
    from samples of <%= link_to "372 songs",
    "http://illegal-art.net/allday/samples.html" %> by other artists.
    The <%= link_to "visualizer", {:controller => "content",
    :action => "visualizer"} %> is an attempt to give a sense of
    wtf is going on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've pulled the timing of the samples from
    <%= link_to "Wikipedia",
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Day#Track_listing_and_samples_used" %>
    and <%= link_to "AllDaySamples", "http://alldaysamples.com" %> (the
    latter for sample end times).
